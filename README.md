# Overview
I have been a [Gunbot](https://gunthy.org/gunbot/) community member since 2019 and decided to help the community out with a need of a standardized containizered app of Gunbot for an easy to run setup.

This setup will allow for a vanilla, Gunbot setup, in less than a minute, allowing fully customizations, while providing one with the latest version, at all times.

# Highlights
Key capabilities of this Gunbot container:

- Latest version tag -> auto-builds with the latest stable version of Gunbot
- Supports HTTPS by default of the Web GUI with a self-sign SSL certificate (requires using persistent data)
- Gunbot Betas are supported, use the tag `:beta`
- [Gunthy Marketplace](https://marketplace.gunthy.io/) custom scripts are supported (requires using persistent data)

# What is Gunbot
